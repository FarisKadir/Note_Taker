# Note_Taker


## Description


I created this application in order to practice using Express, creating APIs, and deploying to Heroku. The application allows a user to write and save notes. When the user writes a new note they can save it and the title of the note will be displayed on the left side column. If a user clicks the note title from the left side column, the right side column will display the note's title and the note's text/content. Additionally, the user can delete the note by clicking the trashcan icon from the left side column.
